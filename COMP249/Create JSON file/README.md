 The purpose of this program is to take an input of any number of CSV files, read them and to create the corresponding files in JSON.
 Scanner is used to open a file to read line by line.
 The program will determine if the information inside the file is valid or not. If valid, it means that there are no empty fields or data.
 Then a new JSON file will be created.
 The user will be asked to choose which created file to output.
 BufferedReader will be used to output the desired file to the console.
