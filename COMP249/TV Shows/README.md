Part 2: Linked Lists
In this assignment, you will design and implement a TVGuide which will determine if a user can watch a specific
show based on shows he/she is currently watching. You are given two files, namely, TVGuide.txt containing
information about various TV shows, and Interests.txt which contains information about the shows a user is
interested in. You will parse these files to extract TV shows information and will produce an outcome for each of
the show a user wants to watch. The outcome for each show could be one of the below mentioned options where
X represents showID, S represents start time and E represents end time.
a) User can watch show X as he/she is not watching anything else during that time.
b) User can’t watch show X as he/she is not finished with a show he/she is watching.
c) User can’t watch show X as he/she will begin another show at the same time.
